As a member of the JWST Telescope Scientist Team (JWST-TST), I used guaranteed time observations planned by our high contrast imaging group at STScI to reveal the atmospheres of the iconic HR 8799 planets at never-before-seen wavelengths of light. The data is described in a <a href="https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/adb1c6">first author paper I published in March 2025</a>. The paper had a press release, <a href="https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2025/news-2025-114">found here</a>. This result validates the findings of our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03776">ExoGRAVITY collaboration paper on the system</a>, that the four gas giants in the HR 8799 system appear to be metal rich compared to their host star, indicating that they formed via core accretion. In order to block the light from the bright host star and reveal these faint planets, we used a novel mode of the Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) coronagraph, placing all the observations at the narrowest end of the underutilized wedge shaped mask.
