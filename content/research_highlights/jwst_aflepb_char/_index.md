I recently co-led a JWST Cycle 2 Director's Discretionary program with <a href="https://kfranson.github.io/">Kyle Franson</a> to characterize the atmosphere and thermal budget of AF Lep b with JWST/NIRCam imaging. With a separation from its bright host star of only 0.3 arcseconds (about 2Î»/D, and 7% coronagraphic throughput) at the time of observation, the planet was particularly challenging to recover with JWST. Nevertheless, in observations I planned based on a feasibility study I led, we successfully recovered the planet at a high significance at its expected location. I am second author on an excellent paper by Kyle describing the exciting evidence for disequilibrium chemistry and enhanced metallicity, which we were able to learn by detecting the planet in these wavelengths.
