In particular, our JWST observations show clear carbon dioxide absorption (CO<sub>2</sub>) in the spectrum of each planet in the HR 8799 system, which, compared to the clear carbon monoxide absorption (CO), gives us a handle on the relative enrichment of heavy elements in these planet's atmospheres. We also observed the young, Jupiter-mass planet 51 Eri b. Despite how faint this planet is, we were able to detect it at a wavelength of 4.1 microns, which tells us indirectly about how hot the planet is, and how much CO<sub>2</sub> is in its atmosphere. Based on these measurements, we can say that these planets likely formed via core accretion. We hope to apply these techniques to characterize more systems in the near future. I was awarded about 23 hours of additional JWST observing time to repeat this experiment in <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information?id=6905">four additional directly imaged systems</a>. That means four more beautiful images of giant exoplanets from JWST coming soon!
