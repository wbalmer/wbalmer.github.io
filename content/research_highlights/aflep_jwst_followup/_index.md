I recently led a [JWST Cycle 2 DD program](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information?id=4558) with [William Balmer](https://wbalmer.github.io) to characterize the atmosphere of AF Lep b with JWST/NIRCam 4.4 micron imaging. At a separation of 320 mas, AF Lep b is a challenging planet to recover with JWST. At these wavelengths, AF Lep b is only two resolution elements (five NIRCam pixels) away from the host star. Furthermore, over 90% of the light from the planet is blocked by the coronograph at this separation. Despite these challenges, we successfully recovered the planet at a high significance at its expected location. The resulting photometry produced clear evidence for the presence of disequilibrium chemistry and enhanced metallicity in the atmosphere of AF Lep b. This is an exciting technical achievement for NIRCam coronagraphy --- **AF Lep b is now the closest separation planet successfully imaged with JWST!**
