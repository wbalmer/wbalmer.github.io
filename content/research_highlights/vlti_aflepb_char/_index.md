One 8 meter telescope is fine, but why not use four 8 meter telescopes at the same time? I use the K-band (2-2.5 micron) beam combining instrument GRAVITY at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) to study exoplanets and brown dwarfs as a member of the ExoGRAVITY collaboration. Using optical interferometry, we make very precise measurements of the orbital motion of giant planets, and collect spectra containing information about the abundances of carbon and oxygen bearing molecules in their atmospheres. I used these techniques to study the orbit, composition, and formation of one of the lowest mass exoplanets directly imaged from the ground, AF Leporis b. In my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05917">first author paper on the system</a>, I showed that the planet's orbit is effectively circular, and the planet's atmosphere is cloudy and strongly vertically mixed. I also evaluated some degeneracies in the Bayesian modeling of the atmosphere, showing why previous studies had overestimated the planet's metallicity (hint: the fault is in our simplistic models of clouds and their impact on the planet's spectrum). This ensemble of results indicates not only that AF Lep b formed via core accretion, but that it hasn't been disturbed by other planets or passing stars since it grew up 25 million years ago.
